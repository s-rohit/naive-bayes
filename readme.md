# NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER
by **S Rohit** (2013107, MTech-Y1) for IIT-GOA CS-561 project, 2020.

The project report discusses the concept and implementation of Naïve Bayes Classifier — a fast
and simple classifier that uses Bayes’ theorem under the assumption that all features are mutually
independent for a given class. Then, the results of testing one such (Guassian) Naïve Bayes Classifier
against an EMNIST dataset of A–Z handwritten character alphabets are presented.

**Usage**: Code given in Python and C++. Provide the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ZY7I1ym0E9s2ecqjfvmPSGwlXzsNi2n) as command-line argument.

**Result** Overall accuracy: \~69%
