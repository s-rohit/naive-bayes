\section{Conclusion}
%===================

The project provides a basic introduction into the field of machine learning 
and shows a small example of how probability theorems are used in practical applications.
\par\medskip
The Na\"ive Bayes Classifier is fast and easy but the biggest disadvantage is that features are assumed to be independent, which is not true for most real life cases. An improved classifier can be built by removing these (na√Øve) independence assumptions and using multivariate Gaussian probability distribution.
